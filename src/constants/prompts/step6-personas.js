## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Entity Guardrails**: Personas MUST come from Step 5 Requesters only
2. **Character Limits**: All bullets MUST be ≤60 characters
3. **Specificity**: Use single first name, specific age (not range)
4. **Evidence**: Validation badges MUST match actual interview counts`,
  userPromptTemplate: `Create Persona Profiles:

---
NEEDS & REQUESTERS (Step 5):
{STEP_5_OUTPUT}

EXECUTIVE BRIEF (Step 0):
{STEP_0_OUTPUT}
---

Generate 3-5 DISTINCT personas using the EXACT template. Each persona MUST:
1. Derive from Step 5 Requesters (use exact requester roles)
2. Have validation badge matching interview count
3. Include all sections (demographics, empathy map, activities)
4. Keep all bullets under 60 characters
5. Name specific current solutions with gaps

Do NOT invent personas outside the Step 5 Requesters list.`
