# Claude Project Context Optimization

This file documents which files to **exclude** when uploading this repository to a Claude Project for optimal token efficiency.

## Files to Exclude (High Token / Low Value)

When uploading to Claude Projects, **do NOT include** these files:

### Lock Files (~28,000 tokens saved)
- `package-lock.json` - Dependency lock file. Claude can reason from `package.json` alone.

### CI/CD Configuration (~200 tokens saved)
- `.github/` directory - GitHub Actions workflows rarely needed for feature development.

### Assets (minimal savings, but noise reduction)
- `public/` directory - Contains `vite.svg` and other static assets that are noise to text-based LLMs.

### This File
- `.context-optimization.md` - Meta-documentation not needed in context.

## Files to ALWAYS Include

These files are essential for Claude to understand and work with your codebase:

| File/Directory | Why It's Important |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `src/` | All application source code |
| `api/` | Serverless API endpoints |
| `package.json` | Dependencies and scripts |
| `vite.config.js` | Build configuration |
| `README.md` | Project context and documentation |
| `.env.example` | Environment variable reference |

## Estimated Context Savings

| Exclusion | Tokens Saved |
|-----------|--------------|
| `package-lock.json` | ~28,000 |
| `.github/` | ~200 |
| `public/` | ~250 |
| **Total** | **~28,500 tokens (~16%)** |

## Large Files Reference

If you need to work on specific features, you may want to selectively include only relevant large files:

| File | Tokens | When Needed |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `src/constants/prompts.js` | ~21,000 | Working on Step-by-Step mode prompts |
| `src/constants/expressPrompt.js` | ~6,200 | Working on Express V1 mode |
| `src/constants/expressPromptV2.js` | ~3,800 | Working on Express V2 mode |
| `src/reportGenerator.js` | ~12,700 | Working on report generation |
| `src/utils/pdfGeneratorV2.js` | ~9,200 | Working on PDF export |
| `src/utils/docxGenerator.js` | ~7,700 | Working on DOCX export |
